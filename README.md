Hello, and it is delightful to see you here!

We are a team whom is trying to deliver a solution, which hopefully helps people coping with low productivity on mobile devices, specifically, Android devices.

According to our observation, making an program that supports basic editing is easy, but the hard part is to make an program that *helps* people on basic editing.

In here, we redefine what "*help*" means to users.

And we believe, once again, that the technology exists to assist, and we provide a new perspective on machine-human interactions.
